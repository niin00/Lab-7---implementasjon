Iris Flower Prediction Web Application

This project is a simple web application that allows users to input measurements of iris flowers and predict their species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on the famous Iris dataset. The app is built using Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn.

Features
- User Input: Enter measurements for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- Prediction: The app uses a pre-trained Random Forest model to predict the iris species.
- Simple Interface: The user interface is built using basic HTML and Flask templates.

Installation

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/niin00/Lab-7---implementasjon
```

2. Install Required Packages

You will need to have Python installed. You can install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install flask scikit-learn joblib
```

3. Train the Model

Before running the web application, you need to train the model and save it. Run the following command to train a Random Forest classifier and save the model as `iris_model.pkl`:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

4. Run the Web Application

To start the web application, run the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

Usage

1. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
2. You will see a form where you can input the following measurements of an iris flower:
   - Sepal Length
   - Sepal Width
   - Petal Length
   - Petal Width
3. After entering the values, click the Predict button.
4. The predicted iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) will be displayed on the next page.

Dependencies

- Flask: A lightweight web framework for Python.
- Scikit-learn: A machine learning library used to train the Random Forest classifier.
- Joblib: A library used to save and load the trained model.

You can install these dependencies by running `pip install` as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.
